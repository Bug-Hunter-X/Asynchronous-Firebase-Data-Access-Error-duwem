This code attempts to access the Firebase Realtime Database asynchronously without properly handling promises or async/await.  It assumes the data is immediately available, which can lead to `undefined` values being used, resulting in errors or unexpected behavior.  The `on('value', ...)` callback might not execute immediately.
