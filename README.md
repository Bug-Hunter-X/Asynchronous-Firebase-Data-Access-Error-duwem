# Firebase Asynchronous Data Access Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error when interacting with the Firebase Realtime Database: neglecting the asynchronous nature of data retrieval.

The `bug.js` file showcases code that attempts to access database data synchronously, leading to potential errors. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version using promises or async/await.

**Problem:** The original code assumes that data is immediately available from the database. This is incorrect because database operations are asynchronous. Trying to use data before it's retrieved results in undefined values, which can cause unexpected crashes or behavior.

**Solution:**  Always handle Firebase Realtime Database operations asynchronously using `.once('value')` with a callback, Promises, or Async/Await. This ensures that your code waits for the data to be fetched before attempting to use it.
